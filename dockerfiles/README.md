## Understanding ENTRYPOINT and CMD

### Lecture 1: What's an ENTRYPOINT?

You remember `CMD`. That's the thing the container runs on start. There's also, `ENTRYPOINT`, which can also run things on start, but how do they work together?

Everytime you start a container, docker takes `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` and just combines them into one long command with a space between them.

### Why would you want this?

Combining `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` allows you to create Dockerfiles for cli tools and scripts. For example, the default `ENTRYPOINT` for the offical nginx image is a script:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

# https://bit.ly/3FXw00f
```
You can create a custom Dockerfile that uses the nginx binary directly. This might be useful if you want to use the cli tool with your own default options using `CMD`. Here's an example, we can replace the default `ENTRYPOINT` and configure nginx to print its help text.

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.21.4
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-h"]
# becomes "nginx -h"
```

> #### ! Note
>Setting `ENTRYPOINT` will remove the `CMD` instruction defined in the base image. If you need it, the `CMD` instruction must be redefined in the current image.

Let's run it.
```bash
docker build -t testnginx . # build image
docker run --rm testnginx   # start container
```

Output:
```
nginx version: nginx/1.21.4
Usage: nginx [-?hvVtTq] [-s signal] [-p prefix]
             [-e filename] [-c filename] [-g directives]

Options:
  -?,-h         : this help
  -v            : show version and exit
  -V            : show version and configure options then exit
  -t            : test configuration and exit
  -T            : test configuration, dump it and exit
  -q            : suppress non-error messages during configuration testing
  -s signal     : send signal to a master process: stop, quit, reopen, reload
  -p prefix     : set prefix path (default: /etc/nginx/)
  -e filename   : set error log file (default: /var/log/nginx/error.log)
  -c filename   : set configuration file (default: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)
  -g directives : set global directives out of configuration file
```
### 4 Rules
There's 4 rules that describe how `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` interact.

Here's a table to visualize what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT` / `CMD` combinations.

#### Summary

So to recap an `ENTRYPOINT` allows you to configure the default executable for the container which can be extended with additional `CMD` options. Doing so allows you to create custom Dockerfiles for cli tools and your own scripts. You'll get more practice in future lectures and learn how to modify ENTRYPOINT and CMD at runtime.

### Lecture 2: USING ENTRYPOINT and CMD in the CLI

You might be wondering if Docker provides a way to modify the `ENTRYPOINT`  without creating a new image? Maybe you want to override the `ENTRYPOINT` at runtime the same way you can override the default `CMD` of an image. 

The `docker run` command has an optional `--entrpoint` flag for this.

![](/docs/images/entrypoint-flag.png)

Let's see an example that modifies both default entrypoint and command. In the previous lecture we saw how we could print nginx help text by creating a custom image. You can do the same thing in the command line.

Run:

```
docker run --rm --entrypoint nginx nginx:1.21.4 -h
```

In summary, you're not forced to create a new image to make changes to the entrypoint. Using the `--entrypoint` flag gives you an alternative approach while using `docker run` and any comamands and aruguments can be appended to the end like usual.

### Lecture 3: Using ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Docker Compose

We've seen how we can use entrypoint and command together in our Dockerfiles and with the `docker run` command, but how does it work with `docker-compose`?

Fortunately, `docker-compose` version 2 and 3 support `entrypoint:` and `command:`.

![](/docs/images/entrypoint-cmd-compose.png)


Let's modify the same example from previous lessons. Imagine you want to inspect the container filesystem of the nginx image.

```yaml
version: v3
services:
    nginx:
        image: nginx:1.21.4
        entrypoint: ls
        command: ["-la", "/usr/share/nginx/html"]
```
```
docker-compose up
```
Output:

```bash
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container test-nginx-1  Recreated                                                       0.1s
Attaching to test-nginx-1
test-nginx-1  | total 16
test-nginx-1  | drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Nov 17 13:20 .
test-nginx-1  | drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 17 13:20 ..
test-nginx-1  | -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  497 Nov  2 14:49 50x.html
test-nginx-1  | -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  615 Nov  2 14:49 index.html
test-nginx-1 exited with code 0
```

> #### ! Note
>  Using `entrypoint:` overrides both the default `ENTRYPOINT` on the image and removes any default `CMD`. 
In other words, if there's a `CMD` instruction in the Dockerfile  __it will be ignored__. So remember to set `command:` if this is not what you want.
